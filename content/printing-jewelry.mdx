title: Printing Jewelry
description: After finding out Shapeways can 3D print & cast metal jewelery I couldn't resist doing a project with this.

My wife is a huge Kingdom Hearts fan, so once I discovered that 3D printing metal was not only possible, but also not overly expensive, I decided I'd make her a custom Keyblade piece.

## Sketching

I started by sketching in procreate using some various key + kingdom hearts references. Sketching right on the iPad with the pencil always feels super good for this part of the process. The portability is great – I actually ended up sketching these on a flight from San Francisco to St. Louis.

Some of the concept sketches. Being a personal piece, there are all sorts of hidden meanings in the symbols here.

A shading pass to work out texture, feel and weight a bit. Love the way this came out. Reminds me of Majora's Mask :) Happy accidents!

## 3D Renders

I'll try to remember to come back and post some of my exploratory sketches, but jumping right to how the renders came out:

These were rendered using C4D + Octane. Material-wise, I think a few of the materials are from one of the GSG material packs. I tend to prefer to make all my own metal materials, as it is quite fun to tinker with all the exact values.

## Prototyping

First I printed a cheap plastic copy to get a feel for the size and iterate on some small details.

The prototype was printed in a smooth fine detail plastic for around $10. I was glad I printed a prototype first, as the wheel spokes in the design ended up looking far too fine in the printed design. I ended up going back to the model and beefing them up a bit.

## Final Prints

I printed the final key through [Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/) and found a chain to match.

The final print was in a rose gold plated brass, and ended up costing around $34. Not bad at all! It was on my doorstep within two weeks of hitting order as well, which is super reasonable.

It feels pretty awesome to hold the cold metal of a physical object that you designed entirely in 3D. I definitely plan on coming back and exploring this space further.
