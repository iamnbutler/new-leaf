This is an ongoing project to help early career designers bootstrap their up to their first job in the tech industry. The goal is to be complete without being overly verbose.

I generally want to bias towards giving direction without being overly opinionated. There are infinite paths, tools and opinions out there, and I hope having a clearly outlined example of an early path will be helpful to some.
