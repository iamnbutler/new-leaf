title: Imagining Worlds with DALLE
slug: dalle-worlds
description: World building has always been a major draw for me to stories, books, films & games, so I wanted to dive into the potential to use a tool like DALLE to rapidly imagine worlds of all sorts.

## Concept Art & Discovering Worlds

I've always been particularily attracted to concept art – Looking at worlds like that of [Guild Wars 2](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/media/concept-art/), Bloodborne, or the worlds of [Ghibli](https://www.iamag.co/ghibli-concept-art-collection/) so much can be felt and understood from a single image. You don't have to play a game or watch a movie to get a feel for the world that exists inside these images.

When I saw people using DALL·E for the first time, I immediately thought "I wonder what type of worlds DALL·E would imagine?" There is a certian sense of serendipity and wonder to typing some words and getting back a world that feels full of secrets and potential adventures. I can only imagine the fun I would have had playing with a tool like [DALL·E](https://labs.openai.com/) as a child.

I've included a collection below of the images and worlds I've discovered while using DALL·E, divided by category. I've added a few example prompts as well to help how the way DALL·E interpretes certian inputs. Time permitting I'll return to add prompts to each image in the future.

## Cube cities

> A floating city in the sky made of cubes. Many waterfalls flow over the edge of the city and fill the oasis below. Outside of the oasis is a desert that goes in all directions. Digital art with vibrant colors.

> Many connected floating cities in the sky with waterfalls flowing off their sides. The cities are made of cubes. Below the cities is a vast desert. Synthwave digital art.

> Two cities made of cubes on cliffs with a ravine between them. Digital art with vibrant colors.
